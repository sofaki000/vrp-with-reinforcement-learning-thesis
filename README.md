## Contents

In this repository we are solving with reinforcement learning some vehicle routing problems. We are starting from the simplest routing problem which is the travelling salesman problem (in TSP folder). Then we solve the CVRP problem (in CVRP folder). Lastly we are solving the EVRP problem (in EVRP folder). 

## Training

We are training the models with early stopping technique.
